> Unfortunately I no longer have time to continue supporting Assistant Relay, and I have personally migrated to Home Assistant where I no longer have a personal need for Assistant Relay.  V3 and V4 will remain in their current state, however if you would like to maintain, please create a fork and let me know so I can add to the ReadMe
